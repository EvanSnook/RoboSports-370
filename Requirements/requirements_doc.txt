Game Summary
    RobotSport370 is a turn-based strategy game in which the goal is to be the player with the last unit(s) standing.
    The game supports two, three or six players and is played on a different size of board depending on the amount of players.
    A game can consist of all human players, all AI players or any combination of the two.
    If there are two players they must play on a size 5 board, if there are six players they must play on a size 7 board, and if there are three players they must choose between the two board sizes.
    Each player begins on a designated tile on the board with their three units, each with slightly different properties.
    A scout which can move 3 spaces, has an attack range of 2, health of 1 and deals 1 damage, a sniper which can move 2 spaces, has an attack range of 3, health of 2 and deals 2 damage, and a tank which can move 1 space, has an attack range of 1, health of 3 and deals 3 damage.
    Games are sorted into different sections:
        A play is where a player has a chance to move or shoot with one of his units, this unit is decided in order of highest movement first and lowest movement last.
        A round is when every player has had a chance to use their unit.
        A turn consists of when everyplayer has now had a chance to play each of their units atleast once. 
    Players can move and shoot in any order, but they cannot exceed their unit’s maximum move distance in their turn but moving is not required and rotating a unit does not cost movement.
    The red player starts the game using their unit with the highest movement, they may move and shoot any units within its range, once red's turn is over, the player to reds left does the same and this continues until it is reds turn again.
    Red then continues the round by controlling his unit with the next highest movement. If a players unit is dead, the player may still make a move with their highest movement unit since their last play
    once a player has no more units to move, the player is out of the game.
    
Summarize programming task
    RoboSport370 can be observed, played as a single player, or played with multiple people. 
    Thus our game has an inherent need for bots with AI to fill up positions that are not occupied by an actual player in cases where you wish to observe or have a match with 2,3, or 6 players, but you do not have enough humans to play.
    The game also has an element that is to hide parts of the board from each player. 
    This is simple to do for an AI as they will only be able to see what their script allows them, but is different for human players as the GUI will have to hide what they are not meant to see.
    additionally, our game will not involve networking, and so if there is more than 1 human player, the screen must be 100% hidden from both players at the end of a turn so that they may switch seats, 
    then the player must press start turn so that neither can see information that should be hidden from them while the turn changes.
    Our softwares arcitectural pattern will be Model View Controller where the model updates the view, and the user sees the view and uses the controller to change the model.
    We chose this because it works well with GUI interfaces and heavy user interaction as we want to be able to choose what inputs the user gives the model so that the view does not do anything unexpected.
    other possible arcitectures would be Presentation-Abstraction-Control and Heirarchical Model-View-Controller. 
    However, both of these would allow for our agents to interact with eachother which is not something that we want because we want them each to manipulate just their data.
    This piece of software will be developed using a specific platform of other programs and software that meet the group’s needs. 
    The hardware this game is designed for will be on the Tuxworld computers in the Spinks Laboratory of the University of Saskatchewan. 
    The main software used will be: GitLab for version control, JSON for structuring data, Microsoft Word for creating documents with images, 
    Discord for group communication, Gliffy for sequence diagrams, Sublime for text editing, and either Netbeans or Eclipse to serve as an IDE. 
    Java, JavaSwing, and AspectJ will be the language used to develop most of the game. 
    The only thing that Java will not be used for is artificial intelligence decision making, which will be done with Forth. 

Stakeholder identification
    This piece of software is being designed and built for Professor Chris Dutchyn for CMPT 370.
    Our stakeholder is interested in our design process and documentation as it is a crucial part of software engineering to actually design your program before you begin to build it.
    during this process he will be looking at which features we choose to and not to add to the program as the project is tailored so that there are certain senarios that arise that we must identify and deal with.
    once we have successfully designed our program, we will then be graded for how well we structure our code and what tools we properly make use of.
    lastly, all of this must be completed in a very strict time frame as the class only runs for one semester and thus we must make use of our time appropriately.
    
    

User Interfaces
    RoboSport 370 will have various screens to display to the user depending on the scenario. 
    The program will start with the Main Menu (Figure 1) and can branch off to other screens such as Create Game (Figure 2), Rules (Figure 3), Stats (Figure 4), In-Game screen (Figure 5), In-game options menu (Figure 6), and an end game screen (Figure 7).
    These images are only mock-ups only, customization and format may change as desired.  Here are the mock-ups of each interface:
    
    Figure 1: Main Menu
    
    	The Main Menu is the first screen the user will see when they run RoboSport 370. It will be the main branch for which the user can branch off of. There are five options that are given: Create Game, Rules, Stats, RoboManager and Quit. There is nothing particularly special about any of these action; Create Game, Rules, Stats, and RoboManager brings up a new screen while Quit will close the program. Remember that the user will always have a way to come back to the main menu from any screen or state they are in. The five options the user has are all recorded with buttons. There is group identification in the bottom right-hand corner as well as a title to complete the main menu screen. 
    	
    Figure 2: Create Game Screen
    
    	The Create Game screen can be brought up via the main menu (Figure 1), and the end-game menu (Figure 7). The user has the option to choose the number of teams playing; either 2, 3, or 6 teams can be selected as a choice using radio buttons. The number of teams selected effects how many teams can be edited and determines the size/s of board radius selected.  If two teams are selected, then only the "Team 1" and "Team 2" options will be able to changed and a 5 hexagon radius will be auto-selected. If 3 teams are selected then only the Red, Yellow, and Blue teams will be uesed and randomly assigned; a radius of 5 will be auto-selected but the user can choose either 5 or 7. Finally if the use chooses "6 teams" then all six times will be editable as our mock-up depicts it.  There is a drop down list for each team where the user can choose if it’s controlled by a human player or by CPU. If CPU is selected for the team, each robot(Scout, Sniper, Tank) can have its own A.I. chosen through a dropdown menu. No two robots can have the same A.I. In addition, an option to change the length of robot turns (0-30 seconds). 
    
    Figure 3: Game Rules Screen	
        The Game Rules Screen is has only one purpse; that is to display the rules of RoboSport 370 in a clean and organized looking scroll box. The user only has the options to scroll through the rules, or to press the back button and return to the main menu (figure 1). 
    
    Figure 4: Stats Screen
        The Stats screen can only be brought up from a button in the main menu (Figure 1). The goal of the screen is to display stats from all known robots in a meaningful matter. They will be able to upload each robot's data to the server (Moodle) as well as reset them completely. The list of robots is inside a scrolling text box to help contain them and will have a sorting option to easily find a specific bot. Stats will be displayed as well in a scrolling text box that distinctly shows which robots stats is being displayed. The user has the opion to upload or reset the selected robots stats, or they can return back to the main menu (figure 1).
    
    Figure 5: Edit-Bots Screen
        The Edit Bots screen allows the operator to add  or remove robots. The only way to enter this screen is through the RoboManger (figure 8) "Edit" button.The operator can leave this screen at any time using the back button, returning them to the RoboManager (figure 8). The user can select a robot from the list to edit them; editing in this case includes changing its name, team name, or its Forth code. There are three input fields to take in changes and there is a save button to override the old info with the new. Selecting a robot should autofill these fields to their current state. There is also a cancel button to undo all changes made and revert back to its previous state.
        
    
    Figure 6.1: Player Point of View
        The player is shown the game board of size 5 or 7, depending the choice of the player or the number of teams in the game. White tiles represent spaces that the player's robots can see and grey tiles represent spaces that the player's robots cannot see. All enemies on grey tiles will be hidden form the player, as the player moves robots around the game board tiles will switch from grey to white and vise versa, revealing enimies as needed. All visible robots have 1, 2, or 3 dots above them, these dots represent the robots health. The dots are will turn black when depleated and remain coloured while available. Each robot also has a name tag, the same name that was chosen in the game creation screen. At the top of the screen there is a team turn indicator.  This displays which team is currently being manipulated.
    
        Players has five buttons at their disposal on the screen: a "Move" button, a "Shoot" button, an "End Turn" button, a "Rules" button, and an "Exit Match" button.
            -The "Move" button will tell the robot to move forward.
            -The "Shoot" button will tell the robot to shoot at the selected tile.
            -The "End Turn" button will end that players turn and move onto the next teams turn.
            -The "Rules" button will show the Rules Menu Screen(Figure: 3).
            -The "Exit Match" button will leave the match without finishing it, and display the Main Menu Screen(Figure: 1).
                
    Figure 6.2: Observer Point of View
        The observer is shown the game board of size 5 or 7, depending the choice of the observer or the number of teams in the game. White tiles represent spaces that the CPU's robots can see and grey tiles represent spaces that the CPU's robots cannot see. All visible robots have 1, 2, or 3 dots above them, these dots represent the robots health. The dots are will turn black when depleated and remain coloured while available. Each robot also has a name tag, the same name that was chosen in the game creation screen. At the top of the screen there is a team turn indicator.  This displays which team is currently being manipulated.
    
        The observer has 6 "Fog of War" check boxes, a "Robot Turn Time" slider, and two buttons; a "Rules" button, and an "Exit Match" button. 
            -The "Fog of War" check boxes are colour codded and labeled for each team. When the "Red" box is checked you will be able to see all the tiles that the red team is able to see, the same goes for the rest of the checkboxes.
            -The "Robot Turn Timer" slider controlls how long the robots will take to complete their turn. If slider is all the way to the left then the robots' turn will be complete almost instantly. The more the slider is to the right the longer the turns will take.
            -The "Rules" button will show the Rules Menu Screen(Figure: 3).
            -The "Exit Match" button will leave the match without finishing it, and display the Main Menu Screen(Figure: 1).
    
    Figure 7: End-Game Screen: 
        The End-Game Screen is a pop-up screen that is displayed over Figure 6 (In-game screen). It occurs in the instance a game finishes and disappears when the user selects one of their three options. The screen is to display the winning team at the top as well as various stats for teams who participated in a scrolling text window. The user then has the option to create a new game which takes the user to Figure 2, return to the main menu which is Figure 1, or quit the program entirely. If the user tries to exit out the pop-up window, they will be taken to Figure 1, the main menu.
        
    Figure 8: RoboManager    
        RoboManager is can reached only from the main menu. On the left-hand side it will display a list of all robots known to the local system, and on the right is a table query of robots stored online. Inbetween the list and table are buttons to interact with all the robots; edit takes the user to the Edit Robots screen, if there is a local robot selected then it will be selected in the new screen as well. An import button will taken a selected robot from the online table and download to the local system. The export button will take a selected robot from the local list and upload it to the online table. Selecting a local robot and pressing the delete robot will remove that robot from the list. Lastly, the user can always use the back button to return to the main menu.

Scenarios
    Menu Operator:
        The menu operator actor has 6 actions, that is to select the rules, select the stats, create a game, edit the bots, or to exit the game.


        Rules:

        As soon as the rules are selected the rules page will be displayed on the screen showing a list of all the rules for the game. The rules remain on the screen until the menu operator chooses to return to the main menu.

        See Fig. RulesMenuSequenceDiagram

        Scenario 1: Rules Is Selected         
        1. The rules are displayed on the screen.
        2. The menu operator reads the rules.
        3. The menu operator returns to the Main Menu.


        Create Game:

        When create game is selected the game creation screen is displayed containing a choice for the number of players, a list of the teams whith a choice to name/choose the robots for each team, as well as a choice for the think time for the AI. The menu operator starts by selecting the number of players, and the extra teams are grayed out and cannot be used. The menu operator then chooses which teams will be AI, and which teams will be humans. If the team is chosen to be a human player the menu operator can then input the names for each tank on the humans team. If the team is chosen to be an AI player, the menu operator can then select the robot to be used for each tank on the AI team. The menu operator also has the choice to choose the robot think time, which determines how long an AI will take to performt their turn. The menu operator then selects to either start the game or cancel all these actions and return to the main menu. 

        See Fig. StartGameSequenceDiagram

        Scenario 2: A Game Is Created Player Vs. AI
         1. The game creation screen is displayed.
         2. The Menu Operator selects 2 players for a game.
         3. Board size 5 is displayed.
         4. The menu operator chooses one human player and one AI player.
         5. The menu operator selects three robots for the AI team.
         6. The menu operator gives his/her robots names.
         7. The bot think time is selected.
         8. The game is started. 


        Stats:

        When the stats are selected the menu creator is taken to the stats screen. On this screen a list of robots is displayed, along with an option to sort the robots, an option to upload the stats of a robot, an option to reset the stats of a robot, a window to display the stats of the robot, an option to return to the main menu, as well as an option to stort the robots by team. The menu operator can choose to sort the robots or leave them as they are initially sorted. The menu operator can then select a robot from the list which will automatically display the stats for the robot in the window. The menu operator can then choose to upload the starts, or reset the stats for the selected robot. When they are done viewing the stats for the robots the menu operator can return to the main menu.

        See Fig.  StatsMenuSequenceDiagram

        Scenario 3: The Menu Operator uploads and deletes the stats for a robot.          
         1. The list of robots is displayed.
         2. The menu operator chooses to sort the robots A-Z.
         3. The menu operator selects a robot. 
         4. The menu operator reads the stats for the robot in the box.
         5. The menu operator uploads the stats for the selected robot.
         6. The menu operator deletes the stats for the selected robot.
         7. The menu operator returns to the menu.

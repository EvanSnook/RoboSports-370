RoboSport 370 will have various screens to display to the user depending on the scenario. The program will start with the Main Menu (Figure 1) and can branch off to other screens such as Create Game (Figure 2), Rules (Figure 3), Stats (Figure 4), In-Game screen (Figure 5), In-game options menu (Figure 6), and an end game screen (Figure 7). These images are only mock-ups only, customization and format may change as desired.  Here are the mock-ups of each interface:
Figure 1: Main Menu

	The Main Menu is the first screen the user will see when they run RoboSport 370. It will be the main branch for which the user can branch off of. There are four options that are given: Create Game, Rules, Stats, and Quit. There is nothing particularly special about any of these action; Create Game, Rules, and Stats brings up a new screen while Quit will close the program. Remember that the user will always have a way to come back to the main menu from any screen or state they are in; note that figure 5 (in game screen) uses figure 6 (in game screen options) to flow back to the main menu. Figures 2,3,4,5,6 and 7 all have the options to return to this from with either a button labeled “Back” or “Main Menu”. 
	
Figure 2: Create Game Screen

	The Create Game screen can be brought up via the main menu (Figure 1), and the end-game menu (Figure 7). The user has the option to choose the number of teams playing; either 2, 3, or 6 teams can be selected as a choice using radio buttons. The number of teams selected effects how many teams show up and determines the size/s of board radius selected.  If two teams are selected, then only the Red Team and Green Team options will be shown and a 5 hexagon radius will be auto-selected and radius of 7 will be grayed out. If 3 teams are selected then only the Red, Yellow, and Blue teams will be shown; a radius of 5 will be auto-selected but the user can choose either 5 or 7. Finally if the use chooses 6 teams then all 6 times will be shown as our mock-up depicts it.  There is a drop down list for each team where the user can choose if it’s controlled by a human player or with a A.I. There will be different A.I. as well that can be selected (example: A.I. – Bot1) and an option to change the length of robot turns (0-30 seconds). 

Figure 3: Game Rules Screen	
    The Game Rules Screen is has only one purpse; that is to display the rules of RoboSport 370 in a clean and organized looking scroll box. The user only has the options to scroll through the rules, or to press the back button and return to the main menu (figure 1). 

Figure 4: Stats Screen
    The Stats screen can only be brought up from a button in the main menu (Figure 1). The goal of the screen is to display stats from all known robots in a meaningful matter. They will be able to upload each robot's data to the server (Moodle) as well as reset them completely. The list of robots is inside a scrolling text box to help contain them and will have a sorting option to easily find a specific bot. Stats will be displayed as well in a scrolling text box that distinctly shows which robots stats is being displayed. The user has the opion to upload or reset the selected robots stats, or they can return back to the main menu (figure 1).

Figure 5: Edit-Bots Screen
    The Edit Bots screen allows the operator to add  or remove robots. The operator can leave this screen at any time using the back button, returning them to the main menu (figure 1). There is a scrolling text box on the left hand side containing the list of all robots for the current system. The user can select a robot and the delete button that is greyed out if no robots are selected, will then become clickable. Clicking the delete button will then delete a robot from the current system. To help with robot deletion, there will be various sorting options to assist in finding a specific robot. To add a new robot, the user must decide whether they will download it from a local directory, or from a server; there are two radio buttons to determine which method the user wants to use to download a robot. If one option is selected, then the input option for the other is grayed out. To download a robot from a local file, there will be a button that becomes visible. When clicked it will display their local file directory so they can choose where the robot is located. As for downloading from a server, an input field will display that asks for a url to the robot.  
    

Figure 6.1: Player Point of View
    The player is shown the game board of size 5 or 7, depending the choice of the player or the number of teams in the game. White tiles represent spaces that the player's robots can see and grey tiles represent spaces that the player's robots cannot see. All enemies on grey tiles will be hidden form the player, as the player moves robots around the game board tiles will switch from grey to white and vise versa, revealing enimies as needed. All visible robots have 1, 2, or 3 dots above them, these dots represent the robots health. The dots are will turn black when depleated and remain coloured while available. At the top of the screen there is a team turn indicator.  This displays which team is currently playing.

    Players has five buttons at their disposal on the screen: a "Move" button, a "Shoot" button, an "End Turn" button, a "Rules" button, and an "Exit Match" button.
        -The "Move" button will tell the robot to move forward.
        -The "Shoot" button will tell the robot to shoot at the selected tile.
        -The "End Turn" button will end that players turn and move onto the next teams turn.
        -The "Rules" button will show the Rules Menu Screen(Figure: 3).
        -The "Exit Match" button will leave the match without finishing it, and display the Main Menu Screen(Figure: 1).
            
Figure 6.2: Observer Point of View
    The observer is shown the game board of size 5 or 7, depending the choice of the observer or the number of teams in the game. White tiles represent spaces that the CPU's robots can see and grey tiles represent spaces that the CPU's robots cannot see. All visible robots have 1, 2, or 3 dots above them, these dots represent the robots health. The dots are will turn black when depleated and remain coloured while available. At the top of the screen there is a team turn indicator.  This displays which team is currently playing.

    The observer has 6 "Fog of War" check boxes, a "Robot Turn Time" slider, and two buttons; a "Rules" button, and an "Exit Match" button. 
        -The "Fog of War" check boxes are colour codded and labeled for each team. When the "Red" box is checked you will be able to see all the tiles that the red team is able to see, the same goes for the rest of the checkboxes.
        -The "Robot Turn Timer" slider controlls how long the robots will take to complete their turn. If slider is all the way to the left then the robots' turn will be complete almost instantly. The more the slider is to the right the longer the turns will take.
        -The "Rules" button will show the Rules Menu Screen(Figure: 3).
        -The "Exit Match" button will leave the match without finishing it, and display the Main Menu Screen(Figure: 1).

Figure 7: End-Game Screen: 
    The End-Game Screen is a pop-up screen that is displayed over Figure 6 (In-game screen). It occurs in the instance a game finishes and disappears when the user selects one of their three options. The screen is to display the winning team at the top as well as various stats for teams who participated in a scrolling text window. The user then has the option to create a new game which takes the user to Figure 2, return to the main menu which is Figure 1, or quit the program entirely. If the user tries to exit out the pop-up window, they will be taken to Figure 1, the main menu.

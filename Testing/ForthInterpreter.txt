ForthInterpreter

	Description
		The ForthInterpreter will be taking in input from Robots as Strings and executing the commands on its Stack using its Words while gathering its information from the GameMaster.
		
	Significance

		Public void execute(String fullCommand)
		Execute a string that contains multiple commands.
        we are testing this so that we can be sure that it works for all kinds of words
        
		public void execute(String fullCommand, HashMap<String, String> userDefinedWord)
		Execute a string that contains multiple commands and may contain a user defined word.
        We are testing this so that we can be sure that it works for all kinds of words
        
		public void executeSingle(String singleCommand)
		Execute a single command.
         We are testing this so that we can be sure that it works for all kinds of words
         
	Testing Plan
	    execute
	        null string
	            assert that an exception is thrown. This is necessary so that we are not executing scripts with undefiened words
	    
	        Literal Word
	            assert that the command is executed.This test ensures that the functionality of Literal Words works
	            
	        Defining Word
	            assert that the command is executed.This test ensures that the functionality of Defining Words works
	            
	        Forth Word
	            assert that the command is executed.This test ensures that the functionality of Forth Words works
	            
	        Comments
	            assert that the command is executed.This test ensures that the user can write comments in a script and still have it work
	        
	    executeSingle
	    	null string

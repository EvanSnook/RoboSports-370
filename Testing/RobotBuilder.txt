RobotBuilder
	
	Description
		RobotBuilder is part of the Model in our architecture, it gives us an easy interface for creating robots and modifying single aspects about them without needing a gargantuan constructor for our Robot class. 
		
	Significance
		public Robot build()
		    This method returns the current Robot with the new changes made to the robot’s variables. We assume that the RobotBuilder constructor calls the right function depending what on the boolean value of "isAI" passed as a parameter. For Robot build to be called it, false needs to be passed as a parameter. If this method is called it will create a Robot object, so we must make sure that it meets the needs of a regular Robot since we are using a builder class. 
		
		public RobotAI build(JSONObject json)
		    This method returns the RobotAI with the new changes made to the robot’s variables. We assume that the RobotBuilder constructor calls the right function depending what on the boolean value of "isAI" passed as a parameter. For RobotAI build to be called it, true needs to be passed as a parameter. Since we are using a builder to create a RobotAI object, we need to assure that a "normal" RobotAI is created. Essentially making sure that the object instantiates a complete RobotAI class.

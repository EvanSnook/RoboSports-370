	Testing Plan
		addLocal
		    robot is null - nothing should be added to the list, an exception should be thrown

		    robot is identical to a robot already in the list - nothing should be added to the list 

		    list is empty - a new list should be created containing the robot

		    list exists with robots already added  - the robot should be added to the end of the list

		removeLocal
		    list is empty - nothing should happen to the list
			
		    list has 1 robot - robot should be removed

		    robot is at the end of the list - robot should be removed

	            robot is at the beginning of the list - robot should be removed, the remaining robots should be moved
	
		    robot is in the middle of the list - robot should be removed, the remaining robots should be moved to account for this 

		    robot is null - nothing should happen, an exception should be thrown

	    	    robot does not exist in the list - nothing should happen

		updateLocalRobots
		    run with no robots saved to the local machine - nothing should be changed

		    run with 1 robot saved to the local machine - one robot should be updated

		    run with multiple robots saved to the local machine - multiple robots should be updated

		    run with multiple robots saved to the local machine but only one has changed - only one robot should be updated 

		loadLocal
		    load a robot that is null - an exception should be thrown

		    load a fully functioning robot - robot should be loaded
		    
		toJSONArray
		    run with robot missing information - an exception should be thrown

		    run with fully functioning robot - JSON formatted file should be created

		    run with robot that already has a JSON formatted file - file should be overwritten

	Significance
		public Libarian()

		public void removeLocal(RobotAI robot)
		This method removes a robot from the list of robots
		
		public void updateLocalRobots()
		This method updates the robots saved on the local machine
		
		private RobotAI[] loadLocal()
		This method loads a robot from the local machine
		
		public JSONArray toJSONArray()
		This method turns all the robotâ€™s information into a JSON formatted file

	Testing Plan
		addLocal
		    Robot is null - nothing should be added to the list, an exception should be thrown.

		    Robot is identical to a robot already in the list - nothing should be added to the list.

		    List is empty - a new list should be created containing the robot.

		    List exists with robots already added  - the robot should be added to the end of the list.

		removeLocal
		    List is empty - nothing should happen to the list.
			
		    List has 1 robot - robot should be removed.

		    Robot is at the end of the list - robot should be removed.

	        Robot is at the beginning of the list - robot should be removed, the remaining robots should be moved.
	
		    Robot is in the middle of the list - robot should be removed, the remaining robots should be moved to account for this. 

		    Robot is null - nothing should happen, an exception should be thrown.

	    	    robot does not exist in the list - nothing should happen.

		updateLocalRobots
		    Run with no robots saved to the local machine - nothing should be changed.

		    Run with 1 robot saved to the local machine - one robot should be updated.

		    Run with multiple robots saved to the local machine - multiple robots should be updated.

		    Run with multiple robots saved to the local machine but only one has changed - only one robot should be updated. 

		loadLocal
		    Load a robot that is null - an exception should be thrown.

		    Load a fully functioning robot - robot should be loaded.
		    
		toJSONArray
		    Run with robot missing information - an exception should be thrown.

		    Run with fully functioning robot - JSON formatted file should be created.

		    Run with robot that already has a JSON formatted file - file should be overwritten.

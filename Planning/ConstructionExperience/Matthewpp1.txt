My(Matthew) first paired programming session was with Wynston and we implemented the code for the initTeams method in the game class. It was a fairly seemless process where we decided what needed to be done beforehand which was to create three conditional if statements in order to determine the number of teams to be initialized. Once we began programming is was easy for us to lay down the code we had discussed and to discuss and solve any issues we came across through discussion.

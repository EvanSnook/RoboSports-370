    My (Wynston) first paired programming session was with Adam where we implemented HexNodeClicked function in the GameMaster class. Before we actually wrote any code we brainstormed briefly on how the method should flow. We quickly came to the conclusion that we would need to use the HexNodeIterator to search through our Board. After that it was very easy transition into actually implementing the method; we both got confused with our loop condition but being able to talk it through with someone helped us understand it. After we got the method to work the way we wanted to, we added an error trap just to solidify the method.

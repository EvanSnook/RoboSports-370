My first pair programming session was with Evan and it rotated around creating an efficient way to traverse through the tiles of the board. We found an effective way to generate the model for the board but decided that making a visual representation based off the model was very troublesome. Since we had a WYSYWIG for creating scenes we ended up hardcoding the two sizes of boards as generating it from the model would not have any benefits. 

My second pair programming session was with Matthew and our goal was to get the robot’s images loaded onto the game board. We ended up changing our Robot class to better suit references the images to keep the design as simple as possible. Once we had the robots linked, we noticed that a method was becoming convoluted so we spent some time splitting it into methods while also improving what they were doing.

Evan & Adam
My first pair programming session was with Adam, whom I have pair programmed with in the past. We worked on GUI and our view controller using JavaFX and .fxml files. Our implementation is slightly different than our design document which made it a bit more challenging, though we decided as a group that this would be a better way to set up our interfaces. The session lasted 2 hours and we were happy with the way that everything turned out as we got our interfaces started and got some of the initial grunt work out of the way as well as we are both more familiar with .fxml files.

Evan & Dylan
My second pair programming session was with Dylan working on an implementation of HexNodes and travering them. We chose this section because We decided to try and hard code the HexNodes instead of proceedurally generating them as we had planned in our design document. In the end we got the board setup and figured out our algorithm to iterate through the board for functions like scan(). We used Team view for the session as we were both at home when the issue arose and decided to figure it out earlier rather than later. The Medium we used worked well as we were able to talk to eachother and use our mouse to point out errors on the other members screen as well as give control of the mouse and keyboard to the other member, so we do not feel as not doing it in person was a limiting factor.

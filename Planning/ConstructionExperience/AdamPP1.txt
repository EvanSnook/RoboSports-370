My first paired programming session went really well. I’ve worked with Evan in the past for other classes so I knew how to work effectively with him.  We got a lot done, it’s an effective way to code.  Our session lasted about 2 hours.  We decided to use java fx for the GUIs. In doing so we got acquainted with the fxml file format.  We are happy with the decisions we made and it is an improvement to our original design.

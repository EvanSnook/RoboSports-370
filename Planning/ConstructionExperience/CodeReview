In the planned code review meeting, we decided to evaluate one of the tougher classes to implement, which is the Forth Interpreter. Dylan wrote the class and so he was the one to walk the group through his implementation. One immediate issue was that one of the methods was several hundred lines long. We decided that this could be resolved by creating a 'factory'. Besides that, the implementation followed the group's coding style guideline (Google) very well; variables followed the naming convention, sufficient use of JavaDoc comments were evident, and so on. The extremely long initWords method was costly since it does not do one simple task which is what a method should be. It makes it difficult for programmers first seeing this code to understand what the function does. Luckily, this can be easily fixed by creating a method for each task done in the method. The only functional issue found is that when two nested loops are put side-by-side, improper output is given. Other than that small issue, the Forth Interpreter class functions as we wanted it to.

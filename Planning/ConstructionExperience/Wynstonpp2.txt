    My (Wynston) second paired programming session was with Matthew where we decided to implement the initTeams method in the Game class. Similar to my first session, Matt and I brainstormed and set out a plan for how the method should function. We both immediately agreed that we would need three conditions for the three possibilities of team combinations. Once that was set up, all that was left to do add each team to the list of teams, and enable the proper teams for each condition. This session went very smooth because the instance one of us froze, the other was able to clarify the error in understanding.

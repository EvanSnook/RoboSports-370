My (Matthew) second pair programming session was with Dylan working on adding the images of the robots to the game board and initializing the images. We started off by deciding what we were going to do and all the changes that needed to be made in order to implement it. Along the way we decided to write the code in an easier more logical way that became clear to us once we started the actual coding. We also made some changes to GameMaster to make it more organized, as well as added a few variables and getters and setters to other classes that we needed. It was very helpful to be able to talk to each other and realize that there was a better way to implement what we wanted.

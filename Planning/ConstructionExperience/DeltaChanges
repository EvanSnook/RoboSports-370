In our Design we had planned on manually coding each GUI and having them all inherit from one AbstractView class. This has been changed so that we are now using JavaFX scenebuilder 2.0 to construct our scenes as it was much quicker and very simple to link up .fxml files to the project. This change also affected how we are drawing our board as originally we had decided to make a Draw() function for our board that drew each polygon individually and then linked them to hexNodes. However, since we started using fxml it makes alot more sense to just hardcode the boards as they dont need to be that robust because we only have 2 types of boards.

Our other major change has to do with how we are Iterating through the HexNodes. Originally we had tried to devise an algorithm for scanning that would take in the robots range and scan the board. however, the boundary cases for such an algorithm proved to be more difficult that we felt necessary. thus, to fix this issue, we made the boards each 3 polygons larger in the data structure than in the view so that our robots can only move to the edge of the view, but since there are extra nodes, we do not have to worry about the boundary cases.

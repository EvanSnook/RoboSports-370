My second session was with Wynston. We implemented the HexNodeClicked function in the GameMaster class.  We thought about the function and its purposed. It quickly came to mind that we should use the HexNodeIterator to iterate through the game board data structure to solve the solution.  It was really handy to have someone there to talk out loud to about the problem and to express our thoughts about how the function should be implemented.  We found the in our opinion the best solution.  We also found a point of failure in the function and added a case to reinforce code.  Over all the session went well I found Wynston and I work really well together and will work together in the future.
